# SMATR-IRRIGATION-SYSTEM
In this project I have made a working prototype model, using   home gateway, sensor, relay module and motor, the programming is done on cisco packetTracer. All the system is integrated in such a way that it monitors water levels as well The water in soil (or) field is sensed by sensor node and the sensed data is sent to microcontroller node through wireless networking .the limits we set in sensor as it works when the water level is less than 5 In comparisons after monitoring for alternate 4 days in traditional way and smart irrigation we analysed the reduction of water wastage was nearly 33% compared to traditional way
